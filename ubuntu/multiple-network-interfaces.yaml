    description: "Multiple network interfaces test for Linaro Ubuntu images.
                  rp_filter is set to 1 by default on Ubuntu to turn on Source
                  Address Verification in all interfaces to prevent some
                  spoofing attacks. For network testing, we set rp_filter to 0
                  so that Ubuntu send and accept packets through the specified
                  ethernet interface"
